- Hammered out several structural blueprints (yaml in general, content dir, data dir, workflow)
- Gained better understanding of project structure (directories and how they work) and Hugo templating
- Added base data yaml and some filler input that still needs validation
- Began building content structure

Moving forward
- Build out content and data skeletons
- Work on templating language to finish building layouts structure
- Build overall site map to keep track of individual pages' needs
- Decide what JavaScript needs/requirements we have for each page
