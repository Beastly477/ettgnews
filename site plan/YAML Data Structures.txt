Data Structure for YAML layout:
(First draft)

State YAML - 
---
title: "" # State name (e.g., Montana)
description: "" # Short 1â€“2 sentence description
capital: "" # Capital city (e.g., Helena)
population: 0 # Full number, no commas (e.g., 1084225)
area_sq_mi: 0 # Area in square miles (e.g., 147040)
tags:
  - "" # e.g., northern, rural, scenic
images:
  header: "" # Path to a nice header/banner image
created_at: "{{ now.Format "2006-01-02" }}" # auto today if you want
---

Counties YAML - 
---
title: "" # County name (e.g., Yellowstone County)
state: "" # Parent state (e.g., Montana)
description: "" # A paragraph or two about the county
county_seat: "" # Main city (e.g., Billings)
population: 0 # Population (e.g., 165123)
area_sq_mi: 0 # Area in square miles
tags:
  - "" # e.g., major_city, growing
images:
  header: "" # Path to a header image for the county
created_at: "{{ now.Format "2006-01-02" }}" # todayâ€™s date

Level	What it would be	Why
1. data/states.yaml	A master list of the 50 states (short info like name, abbreviation, etc.)	For building the top-level menu
2. data/states/{state-name}.yaml	Each state has a YAML with all its counties	Keeps it manageable (instead of a huge file)
3. data/states/{state-name}/{county-name}.yaml	Each county has a YAML file with resources (like contacts, organizations, support centers, events, etc.)	So you can grow or change county resources without touching states
ðŸ“š Example in practice
1. data/states.yaml
yaml
Copy
Edit
states:
  - name: Montana
    abbr: MT
  - name: Wyoming
    abbr: WY
  - name: Idaho
    abbr: ID
  # ... etc
2. data/states/montana.yaml
yaml
Copy
Edit
counties:
  - name: Yellowstone
    slug: yellowstone
  - name: Missoula
    slug: missoula
  - name: Cascade
    slug: cascade
3. data/states/montana/yellowstone.yaml
yaml
Copy
Edit
resources:
  - title: "Public Health Department"
    type: "healthcare"
    url: "https://yellowstonehealth.org"
    address: "123 Health St, Billings, MT"
    phone: "406-123-4567"

  - title: "Yellowstone County Sheriff's Office"
    type: "law enforcement"
    url: "https://ycso.gov"
    address: "123 Justice Rd, Billings, MT"
    phone: "406-987-6543"
ðŸŽ¯ Why this structure is smart:
You can template it cleanly â€” .Site.Data.states.montana.counties loops easily.

You can load resources dynamically â€” Hugo can getJSON or readDir into the folder.

Adding new states/counties is just dropping a small YAML, not editing giant files.

No duplication â€” you don't store "Montana" everywhere inside the county files; you already know which state you're in based on the directory.

ðŸ§  Brain upgrade: Even better later
If you ever want to make it easier even further, you could generate the YAML files automatically (some Python script if you had thousands of counties/resources). But for now, hand-writing them is 100% fine and clean.
